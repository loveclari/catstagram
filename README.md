You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Solutions
For this project, there are solutions listed in the `solutions` folder.  Feel free to take a peek if you are stuck (but only as a last resort!

If you want to load the solutions into the browser, you will need to change out the source of the App component in `index.js`:

```
// instead of
import App from './App.jsx';

// do instead 
import App from './solutions/exercise-6/App.jsx'
```
